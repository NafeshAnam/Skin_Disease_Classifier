# Skin_Disease_Classifier

🩺 Skin Disease Classification using CNN & ResNet18
This project focuses on the binary classification of skin images as Infected or Not Infected using deep learning models, specifically a custom CNN and a fine-tuned ResNet18 (via ResNet50). The goal is to assist in early skin disease detection using image-based AI diagnosis tools.




🔍 Features
✅ Custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

✅ Transfer Learning with ResNet18

✅ Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

✅ Grad-CAM visualization for explainable AI

✅ Preprocessing pipeline for image normalization and resizing

✅ Designed for lightweight deployment in resource-constrained environments
